Directory Tree (Visual Vasic)
=====================

It is a Python script for getting a text of the files contained in a directory. 

This is helpful on Windows when you want to store a list of all the files you'll backup in a CD or DVD.

On Linux there is no need for this tool because you can achieve this with:
```
find . -name "*.*"
```

I wrote this tool thinking on Windows users that don't know how to use Power Shell or/and using older Windows versions.

## Requirements
- Visual Studio 2012 Express
*I'm not sure if this will compile in older Visual Studio compilers.*


## Usage

**Compiling Project**
1. Double click *Directory Tree.sln* so Visual Studio Express [or better] can open the project.
2. Compile the project to create a binary file.
3. Double click the generated binary file.

**Using the binary file**
1. Download the binary file
2. Double click to run it.
3. Select which directory to scan.
4. Select the output format.
5. Select the output filename.
6. Press scan.
